## Overview 
As over time, we have started to depend more on online services, cyber threats have been increasing with a faster rate. There are various websites which involves the usage of sensitive data of users like Online Banking, E-commerce or Social Networking, these websites are used everyday by millions of users and this opens a door for a **Phishing attack**.
  A website similar to the legit website is made and there is a high chance for a users to get fooled by it and enter their valuable info and credentials.
In this project, i have built a phishing website detection system with Machine Learning which is trained on multiple model and achieving an accuracy of 98%. It analysis the data over various aspects and classifies a website into **3 main categories** :
1. Legitimate
2. Suspecious
