color-hash: Generate a Color Based on a Value
===============================================

This module generates a color based on an object, by calculating a color value
based on a hash value for the object. This means the result is deterministic:
the same value will always result in the same color (so long as the hash
function remains deterministic).

This module is a port of the `'color-hash' Javascript library`_. It supports
Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3+.

.. _'color-hash' Javascript library: https://github.com/zenozeng/color-hash


Quick Start
===========

::

    >>> from colorhash import ColorHash
    >>> c = ColorHash('Hello World')
    >>> c.hsl
    (131, 0.65, 0.5)
    >>> c.rgb
    (45, 210, 75)
    >>> c.hex
    '#2dd24b'


Changelog
=========

* color-hash 1.0.2 *(2016-07-08)*

  - Add ``crc32_hash`` function and set default hashfunc to that. It's not
    fully backwards-compatible, but I don't want to bump the version a lot for
    not doing my research.

* color-hash 1.0.0 *(2016-07-07)*

  - Initial port.
